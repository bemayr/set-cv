## Implementation
1. ðŸ”³ Create Preact App
2. ðŸ”³ Intregrate OpenCV
   - We used [https://github.com/theothergrantdavidson/opencv-ts#readme](opencv-ts), and even contributed some Webpack Setup back.
3. ðŸ”³ Set-Up Github Actions
4. ðŸ”³ Access Webcam
5. ðŸ”³ Operate on Camera Stream
6. â¬œ Extract Cards from Background
   - [Detecting Playing Cards](https://arnab.org/blog/so-i-suck-24-automating-card-games-using-opencv-and-python/) (*python, OpenCV*)
   - [Javascript Object Detection](https://hub.packtpub.com/object-detection-using-image-features-javascript/)
7. Detect Sets
